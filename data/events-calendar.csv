    A Multi-Scale All-Atom Molecular Language Model for Predicting Biophysical Properties of Complex Molecules

In silico prediction of complex/emergent biophysical properties from molecular structure / sequence is a long standing goal of computational physics/chemistry/biology. Following the success of protein and small molecule language models, we eschew explicit physics-based calculations (e.g. molecular dynamics) and train high capacity language models to learn molecular representations that are directly predictive of properties of interest. We introduce a novel multi-scale encoding that allows us to represent all molecular entities, from small molecules to large proteins, at a tunable hybrid all-atom / coarse-grained level. This opens the door to modeling modified peptides and proteins, RNA, lipids, etc. in the same framework, maximizing data efficiency and generality, and tunability of of our models. An introduction to machine learning / LLMs in the context of biophysics is presents, and novel contributions are introduced, and preliminary results are discussed. Areas of interest / intersection include physics, machine learning, computer science, biology, and chemistry.

    The Edge Reconstruction Conjecture and Combinatorial K-theory -
Given a finite graph, imagine all the ways you can obtain a subgraph by deleting a single edge. Can you uniquely reconstruct your original graph from just this collection of subgraphs? This question is known as the Edge Reconstruction Conjecture and is a famous open problem in graph theory. In this talk, we will discuss how to rephrase this reconstruction problem more algebraically, using the framework of combinatorial K-theory. This talk is based on joint work with J. J. Gould.

     Dan Gerrity attended Cornell College where he received a B.A. in Chemistry in 1977. From there he went to Harvard University where he earned a PhD in Physical Chemistry in 1982, working in Professor Veronica Vaida’s group. His research focused on the use of short-pulsed lasers to study the electronic structure and reactivity of small molecules. He then did a short (six month) postdoc at the University of Oregon, working with Professor Bruce Hudson, while he waited to get the necessary security clearance required to begin a Director’s Funded Postdoctoral Fellowship at Los Alamos National Lab. At Oregon, he used UV resonance Raman spectroscopy to study the exited electronic states of several small molecules, which included providing experimental evidence for the location and symmetry of the lowest energy forbidden excited state of butadiene. At Los Alamos, he worked with Dr. James Valentini to experimentally measure the product state distribution of one of the simplest bimolecular reactions, H + D2  ➡️  D + HD. These product state distributions provide the best test of quantum calculations of chemical reactions. He also studied the photodissociation of ozone, providing direct evidence for a mass-independent kinetic isotope effect. Dan has been teaching and doing research with undergraduates since 1984, first at Carroll College in Waukesha Wisconsin, and then at Reed College in Portland Oregon.

    Come join us for Cracking Zeus! A new play directed by our own Elizabeth Dinkova '13:
Greek mythology, the Black church, and the crack epidemic collide in the imaginative world premiere production of ""Cracking Zeus"" at Spooky Action Theater, run by Elizabeth Dinkova (Reed '13). Hera, a goddess with a grudge to settle, has found her husband Zeus’ newest illegitimate child. On the outside, Baniaha is a pillar of his community: he helps his mother run her church while mentoring orphaned youth. On the inside, he is lost: the mystery of his paternity leaves him yearning for answers. When Hera arrives to exact her revenge with the help of Rufus, a houseless crack addict she thinks she can exploit, relationships are strained and faith is put to the test. This wildly inventive dark comedy is a present-day myth about religion, dependency, and redemption.
We'll meet at 5:30 for a happy hour at Logan Tavern (1423 P Street NW), and then walk over to Spooky Action (1810 16th Street NW) for the 7:30 curtain. The performance lasts 95 min.

    ""Resolving the ecological causes and consequences of animal mass mortality events""

Death is a ubiquitous demographic process central to understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although all organisms eventually die, the timing and magnitude of deaths within populations varies greatly. In contrast to mortality that affects one specific age or stage class, mass mortality events (MMEs) represent demographic catastrophes that can simultaneously affect all life stages and can rapidly remove a substantial proportion of a population over a short period of time relative to the generation time of the organism. Yet due to their rare and unpredictable nature, we lack an understanding of how MMEs impact ecosystems– which is disconcerting in the wake of ongoing global and regional perturbations to natural systems. This seminar will focus on the use of observational data, mathematical models, and experiments that collectively address what the primary causes and ecological consequences of MMEs are in three parts. I will 1) describe contemporary patterns in the occurrence, cause, and magnitude of animal mass mortality events, 2) present food web theory aimed at understanding the ecological aftermath of MMEs, and 3) present the results of a recent experiment aimed at testing this theory using freshwater lake food webs.

Silver Dollar Road (2023)Directed by Raoul Peck

Silver Dollar Road follows the story of the Reels family as told by the matriarch Mamie Reels Ellison and her niece Kim Renee Duhon, two fierce women defending their rights and fighting to protect their ancestor’s land and their brothers and uncles Melvin and Licurtis, who were imprisoned for eight years—the longest sentence for civil contempt in North Carolina history. The film highlights the ways the legal system is exploited to limit land ownership in Black communities and further contributes to the racial wealth gap.

    “A Grand Convening: Crafting Your Cosmic Sandwich and Envisioning Your Future”  
A culmination of the Memory Activism Event Series

This interactive event will include embodied and somatic visioning and a performative talk, and will culminate in a convivial act of sandwich making and eating.

Participants will be encouraged to connect thoughts about their future with approaches that include speculative and creative engagement with challenges, an integration of body and mind, and an embrace of joy and conviviality as a central tenet of overall wellness. 

Our goal is to encourage students to envision new possible futures for themselves (at Reed, in their communities, their city, and their nation) and truly feel these envisioned futures in their bodies.

By locating this in the new Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center, we hope to highlight and draw connections between body and mind in overall wellness. The event makes practical use of this new space that is geared towards the cultivation of community outside of the classroom while engaging the body, heart, and soul. 

Supported by a grant from the NW5C for Community Engagement, in partnership with the Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center. Open to Reed community members.

As well as a presentation on financial aid, we will attempt to demystify the college admission process and provide a clearer idea of what happens to an application in a selective college’s admission office. We also will discuss application questions such as:


What are colleges looking for?
How should applicants present themselves?
How does one write a strong essay?
Are there resources at Reed applicants can use?

    Reasoning about Laziness is Reasoning about Future: Alternative Semantics to Lazy Evaluation
Lazy evaluation is a powerful tool that enables better compositionality and potentially better performance in functional programming, but it is challenging to analyze its computation cost. Classical works often rely on either reasoning about mutable heaps or modeling sharing via explicit combinators. In this talk, I focus on a different approach: we use alternative semantics that are equivalent to lazy evaluation but more amenable to formal reasoning. I will talk about two such alternative semantics: a clairvoyant semantics based on Hackett & Hutton (2019) and a demand semantics based on Bjerner & Holmström (1989). We show how we can use these semantics to mechanically reason about computation cost of lazy functions using the Rocq Prover (formerly known as the Coq theorem prover).
