    Ecologies of Care through an Environmental Art Practice

We have entered the 6th major extinction event on our planet largely due to the extractive and colonial activities of humans. To reroute this current trajectory requires interdisciplinary approaches for our many entangled species and their diverse life worlds. By joining aesthetics to an environmental practice, I propose alternative visions of the environmental crisis and create opportunities that decenter human exceptionalism in favor of multispecies kinship. I ask, how might we better consider the forms that species interactions take and begin to understand those diverse and unfolding stories through an ecological art practice? I work with community members (both human and non), and interdisciplinary researchers to develop long-term research projects and integrated narratives that take form as written text, paintings, alternative maps, printmaking, installations, animations, community organizing and direct action. 

Specializing in multispecies entanglements under climate change, Juniper Harrower works at the intersection of ecology and art. Through a multimedia art and science research practice she considers the ways that humans influence ecosystems while seeking solutions that protect at-risk species and promote environmental justice.

Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College and Converge 45 are proud to present Jesse Murry: Rising—the first west coast showing of the poetic landscapes of American painter, poet, and art critic Jesse Murry (1948–1993). 

The exhibition is curated by renowned American painter Lisa Yuskavage, and 2022 Kennedy Scholar Jarrett Earnest, and is part of Social Forms: Art as Global Citizenship—Converge curator Christian Viveros-Faune’s city-wide initiative. The exhibition is organized for the Cooley by curator Stephanie Snyder and Converge artistic director Derek Franklin.

Jesse Murry: Rising presents a group of the artist’s oil paintings created between 1988 and 1993, the last five years of Murry’s life, when he was confronted with the reality of his impending mortality from AIDS-related illness. The works testify to Murry’s lifelong belief in the capacity of painting to hold the complexity of human meaning—at the meeting of a material fact and a location within the mind.

At the heart of Rising, dwells the intimate and devoted friendship between Jesse Murry and Lisa Yuskavage. The two painters met at the beginning of their tenure at the Yale School of Art, where they received their MFAs in 1986.

    The first lecture in the series Rising China: Past Reforms, Current Challenges, and New Directions
Presented by Barry Naughton, So Kwan Lok Chair of Chinese International Affairs, University of California, San Diego

“The Government-Guided Market Economy: Is China Creating a New Economic Model?”

For more than a decade, the Chinese government has tried to steer its economy toward a high-tech future. Now, with increased international tensions and growing government ambitions, the Chinese experiment is entering new territory. China seeks to build technological self-reliance and upgrade its massive industrial base while also rebuilding its cities into decentralized clusters. To achieve these goals—while also caring for its aging population—China is experimenting with new planning instruments alongside old-fashioned political controls. Can China's bold effort succeed? What will be the implications for the US and the global economy?

Barry Naughton is the So Kwan Lok Chair of Chinese International Affairs at the University of California, San Diego. Naughton’s work on the Chinese economy focuses on market transition, industry and technology, and political economy. His first book, Growing Out of the Plan, won the Ohira Prize in 1996, and a new edition of his popular survey and textbook, The Chinese Economy: Adaptation and Growth, was published in 2018. His most recent book is The Rise of Chinese Industrial Policy, 1978–2020. Naughton did his dissertation research in China in 19 [...]","Vollum College Center, Vollum lecture hall",2023-09-12,"7pm","Tuesday, September 12, 2023"
