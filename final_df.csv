Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College and Converge 45 are proud to present Jesse Murry: Rising—the first west coast showing of the poetic landscapes of American painter, poet, and art critic Jesse Murry (1948–1993). 

The exhibition is curated by renowned American painter Lisa Yuskavage, and 2022 Kennedy Scholar Jarrett Earnest, and is part of Social Forms: Art as Global Citizenship—Converge curator Christian Viveros-Faune’s city-wide initiative. The exhibition is organized for the Cooley by curator Stephanie Snyder and Converge artistic director Derek Franklin.

Jesse Murry: Rising presents a group of the artist’s oil paintings created between 1988 and 1993, the last five years of Murry’s life, when he was confronted with the reality of his impending mortality from AIDS-related illness. The works testify to Murry’s lifelong belief in the capacity of painting to hold the complexity of human meaning—at the meeting of a material fact and a location within the mind.

At the heart of Rising, dwells the intimate and devoted friendship between Jesse Murry and Lisa Yuskavage. The two painters met at the beginning of their tenure at the Yale School of Art, where they received their MFAs in 1986.

    Portland Baroque Orchestra Concert*Please contact the organization directly for ticketing and event questions. Their number is 503-222-6000.

What better way to herald PBO’s 40th anniversary season than to revel in the rich combination of natural trumpet along with soprano and strings? Our program includes Handel’s youthful Gloria – rediscovered in 2001 – and concludes with Bach’s exuberant cantata, “Praise the Lord in all lands,” featuring PBO principal trumpet Kris Kwapis and soprano Arwen Myers. Nestled between lies a double violin concerto from Vivaldi’s celebrated collection, ‘’The Harmonic Inspiration.” Small wonder it inspired Bach to arrange it for the organ.

Program to include:

George Frideric Handel | Gloria in excelsis deo
Antonio Vivaldi | Concerto for Two Violins in A Minor, Opus 3,
No. 8, from L’estro armonico
Johann Sebastian Bach | Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen
