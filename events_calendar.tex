Panelist and Moderator Bios

Don Berg '12 (he/him) is an award-winning author, education psychology
researcher, alternative education practitioner, and leader. His
award-winning book is Schooling for Holistic Equity: How to Manage the
Hidden Curriculum in K-12. He has over 20 years of experience leading
children in self-directed educational settings. His teaching experience
has been focused on alternatives that empower students to direct their
own learning within the context of caring communities. As the Executive
Director of Deeper Learning Advocates he is on a mission to embed the
psychology of learning in policy so that policy stops undermining
learning. Internationally he has presented his work at conferences in
the USA, Canada, Chile, the Netherlands, and in China.

Liz Gilkey '01 (she/her) is Research \& Evaluation Manager in the Office
of Research, Assessment \& Accountability at Portland Public Schools.
Liz brings over a decade of experience leading large scale and high
stakes research and evaluation with states, schools, districts, and
national and local organizations.~

Her work has focused on equity, measurement and assessment, survey
development, strategic planning, and postsecondary transitions. Her
clients have included the US Department of Education, Oregon Department
of Education, the National Assessment Governing Board, the College
Board, the Council of Chief State School Officers, Oregon Education
Association, and others.

After earning a BA in English from Reed (2001), Liz earned a master's
degree in Educational Leadership and Organizations from University of
California, Santa Barbara (2005); a JD with a focus in school law from
University of Oregon School of Law (2008); and a PhD in Educational
Methodology, Policy and Leadership from University of Oregon (2014).

Dean Schmeltz '14 (he/him) was a Linguistics major. He received his
M.S.Ed. in Intercultural Communication from UPenn in 2018, and spent the
past five years teaching high school English in Denver. Dean recently
moved back to Portland, where this fall he will substitute teach for
PPS.

Mike Teskey '85 (honorary alumnus) (he/him) While~Mike is not a Reed
graduate, he did work in the alumni office for 17 years before
leaving~Reed and moving abroad to work in international K-12 schools.~
The first stop was the American International School of Mozambique where
he and his wife worked for three years before moving to Warsaw and the
American School of Warsaw where he is now. Mike does not work in the
classroom; he is an administrator, and his wife is a music teacher. But
he knows a lot about what international schools offer, how the hiring
works, and what will give folks a leg up should they be interested in
being international educators.~ There are a small group of Reedies~in
this world, and it is a lifestyle and an environment that would suit
Reedies~well.~

Lucia Zaczkowski '89~(she/her) was a Theater major. She teaches middle
grades at Boreal Sun Charter School, a Waldorf-inspired charter school
in Fairbanks, Alaska. She is also the chairperson of her school's
governing body, the Academic Policy Committee. They are a small,

place-centered, Waldorf-inspired program for K-8 students.

Love to sing?
\end{verbatim}

Reed College's choral program invites students, faculty, and staff
singers to our choral program info session on Wednesday, August 30 at
7pm in PAB 320.

There's a choir at Reed for everyone: from the only-in-the-shower singer
looking for a way to explore their voice in a group setting to the
experienced chorister eager to take on challenging chamber choral
repertoire. All the choirs sing a wide array of music of varied eras,
styles, languages, and traditions, and we offer a choral concert each
semester.

Join us this evening to learn more about the choirs and meet some of our
continuing participants! We'll sing a bit, share some info, and open it
up to conversation.
